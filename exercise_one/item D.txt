Q) Consider that I want to query all the people in the database and the engine is taking too long to respond. Which are the possible solutions? How would you determine the problem?

A) The problem might be what we want to get too much unnecessary information from database.
The possible solutions are:
    Get only a part of the values each time, and get process while the next page is querying.
    Reduce the domain, is really necessary all the people?
    Check the query, conditions, joins, etc.

To determinate the problem I suggest check what is getting for the query, and if we need all those values/rows
