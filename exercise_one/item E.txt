Q) I want to query all the students which ages are between 19 and 22. How would you optimize this query?

A) If this query is high priority we can make the birth date in the order key of the table. But this gets worse performance to add a new student.
We can also create a view with the students that have between 19 and 22 years old. And a stored procedure that updates this on a new student or each some time (day, week, month)
